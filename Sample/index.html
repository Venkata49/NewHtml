    <p><b>What is a paragraph?<br></b>

       Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
       Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
       a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
       a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.

It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 which has new and efficient way of handling elements such as video and audio files.

    <h3 align="center">JavaScript </h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.
